# pyegsphsp

Read and write egsphsp (EGSnrc phase space files) from Python.

**_NOTE_** You are far better off using my [beamdpr](https://github.com/henrybaxter/beamdpr) a command line utility written in Rust

But if you _do_ want to use this, [let me know!](https://github.com/henrybaxter/pyegsphsp/issues)

## Requirements:

- Python 2.7, 3.x

## Installation:
